# 100-commits-challenge (under construction)

Programming is a very useful skill. 
To make use of it, I am building an app that may be used for management of a psychotherapy clinic that is lead by my Partner.
In that way, I'm using my software engineering skills as well as free time that I have between preparing and 
sending my CVs to potential 😈 employers (currently I'm unemployed).
To stay motivated, I decided to take part in [100 commits contest](https://100commitow.pl/).<br>

#### As for the starting day of a project, I plan to use: ####

* **Spring** for backend
* **Angular** for frontend
* **RxJS** for Angular, as I love functional and reactive programming 😍 😍 😍
* **PostgreSQL** as a database to store data and **pgadmin** to manage it
* **Docker** for PostgreSQL and pgadmin for easier management and exchange (I allow the possibility to exchange PostgreSQL for MySQL in near future)
* **Liquibase** for managing database development
* the most important: my recent **job experience** as **a Java Developer** 😈 (I have 2 and a half years of commercial job experience as a Java Developer).
As I'm unemployed now, in case you are wonder, I may give the minimum hourly rate I expect: 35 PLN per hour (B2B)
